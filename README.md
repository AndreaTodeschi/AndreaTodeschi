- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AndreaTodeschi, I'm Italian and I'm an aspiring Dev
I've started learning at the start of 2021, starting with java and SQL to make a few backend project. With some javafx to give a user interface
Now I'm in the process of learning about web development as I have a project in mind, but I'm trying to do things right. I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and python (with Django for more SQL), but my project will be using reactjs, nodejs and mongoDB so I can learn about noSQL too
