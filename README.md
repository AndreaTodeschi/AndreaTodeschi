 Hi, Iâ€™m @AndreaTodeschi, a 25 years Italian aspiring web dev
At the start of 2021 I made a resolution to finish what I had started learning in university a couple years earlier, coding.

I picked up Java and SQL to start my journey, using PostgreSQL, Hibernate and JavaFX to try building a personal project idea I have since a long time. I managed to get it somehow working but ran into a lot of scalability issues while building the UI.

So I decided to learn web development, HTML, CSS and JavaScript (along with a little bit of Python with Django) and build a frontend with Reactjs (well it's mostly TypeScript since not having type checking really bothered me), and liked it so much I decided to rebuild my entire  backend with postgres, Express, Apollo, GraphQL and TypeORM.

Right now I stopped my personal project to build my first commission, a static site using NextJS with Chakra-UI, Google Maps API, it's taken me about a month since I can only do this on my free time, but it's almost done now
