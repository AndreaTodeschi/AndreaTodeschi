 Hi, Iâ€™m @AndreaTodeschi, a 25 years Italian web dev
At the start of 2021 I made a resolution to finish what I had started learning in university a couple years earlier, coding.

I picked up Java and SQL to start my journey, using PostgreSQL, Hibernate and JavaFX to try and build a personal idea I have since a long time. I managed to get it working on the base functionality, but I have since decided to rebuild the entire project with node and react to make it more easily manageable.

SO i started learning web development, HTML, CSS and JavaScript (along with a little bit of Python and Django) and build a frontend with Reactjs (well it's completely in TypeScript since not having type checking really bothered me), and rebuilt the entire backend using postgres, Express, Apollo, GraphQL and TypeORM.
While learning frontend dev, i built a static site using NextJs, and faunadb as a serverless database to hold the data. you can check it out at https://vacanzenelvanoi.com/. It is a bit of a mess but it was indeed the first project that saw the light of day.

Now I have just finished my personal project and am currently testing the version 1.0.0 at scale. It is a B2B Saas idea, and as soon as I'm done building the website I'll sell it with (am using Astro.build with react components), I'll also publish that one.
