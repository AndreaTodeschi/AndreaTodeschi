- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AndreaTodeschi, a 25 years Italian aspiring web dev
At the start of 2021 I made a resolution to finish what I had started learning in university a couple years earlier, coding.
I picked up Java to start my journey, using Hibernate and JavaFX to try building a personal project idea I have since a long time. I managed to get it somehow working but ran into a lot of scalability issues while building the UI.
